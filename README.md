# LLM-Classifier-of-Political-Texts


This project was conducted as part of my MSc Thesis. I train and evaluate a large language model (LLM) to classify political texts by ideology, using fine-tuned transformer architectures and human-labeled manifestos.


## üéØ Overview

- **Goal:** Detect the use of civic vs ethnic nationalist ideologies in political party manifestos (PDFs) on a 0-5 intensity scale.
- **Context:** Why is this interesting or important? (real-world motivation)
- **Data:** Where did the data come from? (link if public)
- **Output:** What are the main deliverables (model, dataset, visualization, paper)?


## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Outline your approach step-by-step. Keep it short but structured.

**Example structure:**
1. **Data Collection / Cleaning:** Describe preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, geocoding, filtering).  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Mention key features or transformations.  
3. **Modeling / Analysis:** Summarize models used (e.g., LightGBM, RDD, LLM fine-tuning).  
4. **Evaluation:** Describe metrics, cross-validation, baselines.  
5. **Visualization:** Note how results were presented (plots, maps, dashboards).
