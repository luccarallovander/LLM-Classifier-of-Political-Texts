# LLM-Classifier-of-Political-Texts

This project was conducted as part of my MSc Thesis. I train and evaluate a series of large language models (LLM) to classify political parties in two ways:
-using structured meta-data from the Manifesto Project Database (MPDS)
-scaling the text of the party manifestos by ideology over time, producing a panel dataset.

# Skills Used
-LLM-based classification of tabular data (OpenAI, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Mistral 7B Instruct, GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned)
-LLM-based text classification (NLP)
-Causal Inference (Two-way Fixed Effects Models, Multiple Regression)
